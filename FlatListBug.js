This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or improperly formatted data structure to the `data` prop.  For example, if your data is not an array, or if the array contains elements that are not objects (assuming you're using keyExtractor), you'll encounter this error.  It can also occur if `keyExtractor` isn't correctly extracting a unique key for each item in the data array.  The error message might not always clearly state the root cause.  Common symptoms include a blank screen or a crash with an error relating to the data source or rendering process.
